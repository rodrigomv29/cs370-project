Rich Paul has become one of the Premier, agents in professional sports he counts, LeBron James as a close friend and, client the agency he founded clutch, Sports Group made deals worth almost, $900 million this past summer for his, NBA clients alone Paul honed his deal, making instincts as a kid navigating, what he called the Hostile streets of, his Cleveland neighborhood today at 42, he's rewriting the playbook for, representing pro athletes Rich Paul told, us he was lucky and when you hear his, story we think you'll understand, why the story will continue in a, moment so did you used to come to games, when you were younger I went one time, when I had to um sit all the way up at, the top you really couldn't couldn't see, the person and, now now it's now you're sitting on the, floor we joined Rich Paul courtside at a, Cleveland Cavaliers game last season he, seemed to know, everyone what up do what's good and it, seemed everyone wanted to know, him thank you so much you're my ID bro, thank you brother I appreciate it last, year Paul got Cleveland star Darius, Garland a $200 million deal the richest, in franchise history Garland is one of, nearly 200 athletes on Paul's roster who, are some of the big names that we would, all recognize which sport you want I, mean we just had Jaylen herzon and, Devonte Smith playing the Super Bowl for, the Philadelphia Eagles and then you got, the Anthony Davis's and uh Draymond, greens and obviously LeBron do you know, the total value of the contracts you've, negotiated I would say it's close to 3, billion I think it's more than 4 billion, but it's hard to keep track when you're, always on the go showtime baby before, the NBA draft in New York City we, watched him work the phones you know, it's draft day man anything can happen, work the room hey coach how you doing, man right and work the angles to move, clients like Duke Center Derek Lively II, up the draft board you ready sir in, college Lively was known for his defense, but Paul had him work on his three-point, shot and before the draft invited teams, to see Lively shot up to the 12th pick, about 10 spots higher than first, projected it might not look like it but, Rich Paul is a towering figure in the, NBA I've always been the smallest guy in, the, room willing to take the biggest swing, some of his biggest swings have been for, his biggest client LeBron James Paul, negotiated his jumps from Miami to, Cleveland to LA a deals that netted, James $400 million and set him up to win, two of his four, championships he told us he works to, give players leverage some people say, that you're destroying the player, loyalty to the teams and the fans player, loyalty to what if I can be traded in, the middle of the night to another team, what I should be is educating myself to, where if this isn't going the way I, thought it was supposed to go I can, switch up right we're not I have options, I have op what's the sister to having, money with no, options that's apparently how Superstar, Anthony Davis felt in 2018 the New, Orleans Center had a $127 million, contract but was tired of losing so he, fired his agent and hired Rich Paul Paul, flouted NBA rules by publicly demanding, a trade earning the wrath of fans and a, $50,000 fine for Davis the drama landed, Paul on the cover of Sports Illustrated, which called him the most polarizing, figure in the, NBA when it was someone that didn't look, like me it was genius it was why you get, a power agent but when it's me I'm, destroying the league I mean those, things are absurd he got d us what he, wanted a championship ring and a deal, now worth $270, million there's a saying that goes if, you a got no haters you ain't, popping so you must be popping I think, I'm popping a little bit you know he was, popping a lot at his annual allstar game, party this past winter in Salt Lake City, is that we dropped in and saw giants of, the court mingling with rappers team, owners and Titans of Industry over, cocktails and canipes Rich Paul had a, full plate of business options one from, the president of Gatorade I want to be a, first call done while we were chatting, with, him Golden State Warrior Draymond Green, cut in the four-time NBA champion cycled, through two other agents before signing, up with Rich Paul who landed him a $100, million contract over the summer so then, you end up a young black man who's made, more money than you can ever imagine but, you don't know how to live with it you, don't know what to do with it and what, does he do most agents treat athletes as, if the athlete work for them but there's, a multi-billion Dollar, business going on around most athletes, that they don't understand but they, don't have a rich part to teach them and, that's what's special about it Paul's, improbable Journey the subject of his, new Memoir out this week started on the, east side of Cleveland in the early, 1980s just as crack cocaine hit the, streets when he was about 4 he learned, his mother manura was hooked on crack, his father Big Rich recognized his son's, intelligence and kept him close though, they lived apart he owned the, neighborhood convenience store so your, dad's store was just right in here yeah, and this was this was my world this now, empty Corner was a hot bed of activity, legal and illegal it was a shootout, right here on this corner Big Rich, taught his son to always think two steps, ahead he scraped together the money to, send him to a Catholic High School away, from the neighborhood still there was no, avoiding the streets you don't know what, you're in that's your Norm that's my, Norm sardines out the can that was, today's version of tuna tartar on the, Waldorf, rooftop know this was my education, though this was this was my Harvard my, Michigan my morehous and the same things, I learned on this corner I take it to, the board room because the one thing, this teaches you that I don't think you, can learn from those institutions is, people, characters and on these streets it's no, better way to learn character because, they're coming with everything his dad, taught him another skill a way to make, money if all else fails with a Pair of, Dice Paul and his best friend Edward, given were regulars at an open air, Casino in the park 50 people crowded, around this little area and the energy, was high it was it was an arena and Rich, Paul was a natural and how much would, you earn I mean a slow day was $1,000, and a not slow day, H you know four or five $4 or 5,000 easy, when you were 14 15 16 oh yeah what did, you learn from this experience you gain, a resilience here we won majority of the, time but you also had to learn how to, lose he suffered his biggest loss when, he was 19 his father died from cancer, and Paul went all in on the streets, selling marijuana and crack cocaine this, is the very drug that your mother was, hooked on the absence of my, dad allowed me to to take that step, because I would have never done that had, he, been around I had too much respect for, him if it's not something that I would, sit here and and glorify it almost, sounds like you were a full-time Hustler, oh yeah but Jeff Bezos is a, hustler think he's not Phil Knight was, the ultimate Hustler the difference is, they could go with their plan and their, business, idea and get someone to believe in them, it didn't matter what idea I had there's, no Pathway to get there he found one, through a stroke of luck at the akan, Canton Airport in 2001 Paul was wearing, a throwback jersey like this one that, caught the eye of another traveler High, School hoop sensation LeBron James what, did you see in him it began with him you, know wearing a throwback jersey that I, you know loved but as we got to talk, about sports we started evolving and, even talking more and more just about, life and about our upbringing about our, our moms and and and our communities and, stuff of that nature and it um just kind, of struck it just struck a core when, James entered the NBA he hired Rich Paul, as a right-hand man Paul went on to work, for LeBron's agent and watched listened, and learned, I understand that you would go into, meetings with the likes of Warren, Buffett being in those, rooms is much better, to to listen than to talk if you listen, you might actually learn something and, you start to kind of you know work your, way on your own after just four years he, struck out on his own and launched, clutch Sports Group in 2012 LeBron James, went with him when you first started, this you were underestimated Not only, was I underestimated I was also not, wanted I didn't look like the success in, our industry especially from a place of, decision-making and I wanted to disrupt, the industry I wanted to be impactful, but I wanted to come from a place of, purpose in 2013 with his first, negotiation as agent for Phoenix Sons, guard Eric bledo he proved the naysayers, wrong he said the sons had offered $28, million and then $48 million and you, turned it down yeah but what was on the, line my, career everyone was calling and saying, he's crazy he don't know what he's doing, he's an experienced it sounds like you, are really comfortable rolling the dice, I was born a dice roller his gamble paid, off after hanging tough for a year, clutch got bled so a $70 million deal 42, million more than the son's first offer, great room today clutch has 70 employees, with offices in Los Angeles New York and, Atlanta and they both in the same draft, class Paul teamed up with Powerhouse, agency UTA to expand clutch's reach I, had to build a multi 100 million dollar, company to get people to believe in me, and there's still doubt critics say he's, only successful because of his, relationship with you I mean it's, disappointing to hear that would you, gave him an opportunity yeah and I don't, give people opportunities much um and he, took well Way Beyond um than what he, even imagined Rich Paul now has a new, balance signature shoe a first for an, agent his partner is more famous than he, is he's been in a relationship with, Adele for 2 and A2 years Adele she gave, him a shout out at the Grammys oh God, Rich he he said don't cry if you win, anything tonight don't cry and here I am, crying a couple of weeks later at his, allstar game party Paul's friends, recognized his achievements from us this, from us with a, $140,000 watch, wow, wow wow do you have to pinch yourself, sometimes all the time I had it worse, than a lot of people but I evolved I, matured I transitioned how's that feel, feels great it feels, earned you know it wasn't given for sure, it was earned which is good I like, that,

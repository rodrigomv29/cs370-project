tonight Scott Pelley reports from, Ukraine where he sat down with president, velodimir zielinski in the capital keep, the story will continue in a moment, we met president zielinski as he, prepared to depart key for the United, States this week he will speak at the, U.N and meet President Biden it is a, critical time U.S officials tell us that, over nearly 600 days almost half a, million troops have been killed or, wounded both sides altogether, part of the cost so far of Vladimir, Putin's unprovoked invasion we spoke to, zielinski on Thursday he told us that, his people are dying every day to, prevent World War III, um, we're defending the values of the whole, world zielinski said and these are, Ukrainian people who are paying the, highest price, we are truly fighting for our freedom we, are dying, we're not fiction we're not a book we're, fighting for real with a nuclear state, that threatens to destroy the world, the United States has contributed about, 70 billion dollars to your war effort, and I wonder if you expect that level of, support to continue, the United States of America is, supporting Ukraine financially and I'm, grateful for this, I just think they're not supporting only, Ukraine alone if Ukraine Falls Putin, will surely go further what will the, United States of America do when Putin, reaches the Baltic states when he, reaches the Polish border he will, this is a lot of money we have a lot of, gratitude what else must Ukraine do for, everyone to measure our huge gratitude, we are dying in this war, look if Ukraine Falls what will happen, in 10 years just think about it if the, Russians reach Poland what's next a, third world war, what will it take another 70 billion, yeah, I don't have an answer the whole world, has to decide whether we want to stop, Putin or whether we want to start the, beginning of a World War, we can't change Putin Russian Society, has lost the respect of the world they, elected him and re-elected him and, raised a second Hitler they did this we, cannot go back in time but we can stop, it here, Ukraine stopped the Russian advance but, at a terrible cost ruined cities, millions of refugees Untold thousands of, dead, all four Vladimir Putin's nation, building vanity, today the war is fought on a 700 mile, front the red area is the 20 percent of, Ukraine still occupied by Russia this is, where Western donated tanks were, supposed to punch through cutting the, Russian Force in half, but trenches minefields and artillery, stopped the armored Advance now it's an, artillery duel with each side firing, about 40 000 shells a day, Ukrainian infantry is advancing bloody, yards at a time, it's World War One, with drones, how would you describe the fighting at, the front, um, it's a difficult question I'll be, completely honest with you we have the, initiative this is a plus, the Russian offensive and we moved into, a counter-offensive but despite that, it's not very fast it is important that, we are moving forward every day and, liberating territory you have about six, weeks of good weather left and I wonder, after that point will the front be, frozen in place, we need to liberate our territory as, much as possible and move forward even, if it's less than half a mile or a, hundred yards we must do it we can't, lose time forget about the weather and, the like in places that we can't get, through in an armored vehicle let's fly, if we can't fly let's send drones, we mustn't give Putin a break, if the front is stationary Ukrainian, drones have vaulted into Russia itself, hitting the Kremlin warplanes and Moscow, high-rises officially Ukraine does not, acknowledge these attacks the drone, strikes in Russia are being done on your, orders, no not on your order well you know how, is this happening at the shore you know, we don't shoot at the territory of the, Russian Federation, we decided to try the question another, way what message is being sent with, these drone strikes in Russia, you do know that we use our partners, weapons on the territory of Ukraine only, and this is true but these are not, punitive operations such as they carry, out killing civilians but Russia needs, to know that wherever it is whichever, place they use for launching missiles to, strike Ukraine Ukraine has every moral, right to send a response to those places, we are responding to them saying your, sky is not as well protected as you, think, last winter it was Ukrainian Skies that, were filled with missiles in a Russian, bombardment to destroy power plants, Millions shivered in the dark, with winter approaching again zielinski, had this warning, they must know if you cut off our power, deprive us of electricity deprive us of, water the privacy of gasoline you need, to know, we have the right to do it to you, Russia takes Solinski seriously now, because Putin's Mass invasion was a, fiasco the red marks where Ukraine, stopped Russia's Advance last year, it also marks the stain of Russia's war, crimes Mr President in traveling around, Ukraine for the last year and a half, we spoke to people in bombed out schools, in chernoheve, we've seen destroyed apartment blocks in, borodianca a bombed Hospital in isium, civilians in a mass grave in bucha these, are not military targets, what is Vladimir Putin trying to do, to break us, and by choosing civilian targets Putin, wanted to achieve exactly this to break, us this person who has made his way with, such bloody actions with everything he, has said cannot be trusted there is no, trust in such a person because he has, not been a human being for a long time, the Russians have suffered Grievous, losses, without resorting to nuclear weapons, and I wonder if you believe that the, threat of nuclear war is now behind us, I think he's going to continue, threatening, he's waiting for the United States to, become less stable he thinks that's, going to happen during the U.S election, he'll be looking for instability in, Europe and the United States of America, he will use the risk of using nuclear, weapons to fuel that instability he will, keep on threatening, that U.S election he mentioned worries, him his negotiations with President, Biden have been contentious at times but, zielinski tends to get what he asks for, even if in zelinski's opinion it's, generally six months too late, this week zelinski will press Mr Biden, for missiles with longer range Congress, is debating another 24 billion dollar, package, and if Ukraine had enough of these, modern systems we would have already, restored the territorial Integrity of, Ukraine we would have already done that, these systems exist are you safe here, we first met zielinski not long after, the invasion when his office was a, blacked out bunker be careful now a year, and a half later we noticed a difference, as we were setting up the interview the, former actor used his talent to mask the, strain he smiled at a compliment to his, wife yeah so great and then instantly he, seemed pulled beneath a depth no one can, know, we don't know what he was thinking it, looked like empathy, for the Lost, and for those who might be saved, our time was solinsky began in silence a, remembrance of the fallen during a, ceremony to award Medals of Valor, Ukrainian officials tell us Ukraine and, Russia have lost their professional, armies now the forces are made up of, volunteers draftees and in Russia's case, prison inmates, zielinski counts his dad in casualty, reports each morning you are the, president but it must be humbling to, meet those men I wonder what they mean, to you, yeah first of all it's a great honor for, me I look into their eyes and it makes, me proud that we have such strong people, because this is a big risk a big risk, you can definitely lose your life for, the sake of saving other lives and when, I say other lives I don't speak in, general I mean my own life the lives of, my children and I understand completely, what risks are involved, that empathy for life has velodimir, zielinski reaching out again to the, United Nations and the United States, hoping to convince the Allies that the, world can be safe only when Ukraine is, whole can you give up, any part of Ukraine for peace, no this is our territory you must have, it all including Crimea, of women, today you and I you said it to me you, saw me awarding people

60 Minutes rewind, say Denzel and most people would know, you're talking about one of the highest, paid and most popular actors in, Hollywood, but 30 years ago Denzel Washington was, just another unknown struggling New York, actor today he's playing the lead in a, Broadway play and making standard union, wages a fraction of what he'd make in, Hollywood so we went to see it man I, remembered a story he told me five years, ago about an incredible prediction that, he says started it all, I was in my mother's beauty shop, and I was looking in the mirror and I, saw a woman sitting across the room for, me, and she said to my mother bring me a, piece of paper, she said I have a prophecy it's the, God's honest truth I got the piece of, paper and I'll keep it with me all the, time, and she wrote down she said this boy is, going to speak to millions of people, I don't talk about that a lot but I've, kind of felt like well maybe I have some, job to do remember the woman I tell you, about the prophecy that was 30 years, that will be 30 years ago next week, right and then I started acting that, fall so it's kind of interesting coming, back now 30 years later about 20 blocks, from where I started wins, countrymen, and love us Denzel Washington's career, began on the Obscure stage at New York's, Fordham University but today he is, headlining on Broadway appearing in a, modern day production of Shakespeare's, Julius Caesar he plays Brutus one of the, leaders of a plot to kill Caesar not, that I, but that I love Rome more why did you, decide to do this play now I thought it, was a great opportunity to get back on, the stage to get back to my roots and I, get so few opportunities to get on the, stage, so when I do I really like tackling, Shakespeare which is the toughest and, the most rewarding, I mean it took me 30 years but I'm I, finally am doing what I wanted to do, when I started the actors I I started, with in college and we were all snobs, and we thought we would you know make, 600 a week in on Broadway or whatever it, was back then we didn't think about, going to Hollywood that was some, Hollywood you didn't do that, but he did and it is his acting in those, Hollywood movies that has made Denzel, Washington a household name happy, birthday you just made my mother's, birthday all right he's been in more, than 30 feature films and won two, Academy Awards best supporting actor for, his portrayal of a runaway slave in the, film Glory Days of training day, officeroy and in 2002 best actor for his, performance as the dirty cop Alonso, Harris in Training Day but I ain't, holding no hands you understand I ain't, babysitting you got today and today only, to show me who and What You're Made Of, You don't like knock his name has become, synonymous with Hollywood box office, Blockbusters most recently he played, Major Ben Marco in a remake of The, Manchurian candidates, big Steel, toe cable Cutters in a chainsaw and they, went to town you've been working a lot, since we talked five years ago you've, done what, seven films since then and since what, year was that 99 yeah okay, I mean it's a lot of work, uh is it, I mean work is like, you know garbage man is work I'm acting, is not work acting is is a privilege and, it's a craft and and all of those things, but uh, it's not work I read that you get 20, million to film now, I heard you make that kind of money too, I'm not there yet are you not there yet, are you finished I thought I was just, getting started tell you something, something may have slipped your mind, but you are addressing a superior, officer you understand me in 2002 in the, film Antoine Fisher Denzel played a Navy, psychiatrist counseling a troubled, sailor cut cut okay in addition tackling, a new role as the film's Director, his face right in our face for our first, shot you know did you enjoy directly, absolutely I'm going to do it again and, when it comes to one or the other I mean, you'd like to do both or do you prefer, acting over directing, um, I look at Clint Eastwood as the model, that's that's I like the way he's doing, things and that's how I'd like to do it, just, segue right on into into more and more, filmmaking a Hollywood director's chair, is a long way from where he grew up in, Mount Vernon A working class suburb, outside New York City, his mother lennis managed that beauty, shop his father Denzel senior was a, Pentecostal preacher who held down two, other jobs Denzel went to church every, Sunday but dreamed of becoming a, professional athlete he spent all of his, free time here at what was then the boys, club, this was an important place for you yep, I lived here my mother would have to, come get me so that you had a time when, you had to come home nine o'clock man I, had a I had a time I knew how to get to, the fish market by 8 54 and by the, chicken joint by 856 in order to make it, home by nine o'clock does she ever have, to come looking for you she did, she would, we were in the park and she came and, they were like I did your mom's here and, I got in the car, and she was screaming so I kind of look, at everybody at the window like like you, know I got this as I was as I was, turning around, so I put my head under the dashboard, just drive mom just drive Denzel says, his mother lennis saved his life when, she scraped together enough money to, send him to Oakland Academy a small, boarding school for boys in Upstate New, York he hadn't been back there for 20, years and was surprised to see his old, school being converted into Condominiums, man it looks so little now, my God Denzel was 14 when he came here, one of only a handful of, African-American students how did you, end up here, I am, was in public school Mount Vernon High, School, and my mother decided it was best, to get me out of there, before, I ended up, where a lot of my friends are now, in you know in the grave, in the penitentiary how were you up here, I mean were were you a bad kid, no, no, angrier as time went along what were you, angry about come on let's take a walk in, here, right about here, was a chair, and I was sitting in the mess hall, whatever we called it and they told me, your mother's here, what did I do I did something wrong, and I came right about here sat down and, uh she said your father and I aren't, together anymore, you're going to be with me you know I, don't know what I'm going to do but, we're going to work it out so this is, where I found out my parents were, getting divorced right here right right, here right here I remember it like it, was yesterday, so to answer your question about anger I, think I started getting a little trouble, after that started getting in fights, and almost kicked out of school but his, mother talked the Headmaster into giving, him another chance you owe her a lot I, ordered everything, I assume you told her that in many ways, the story will continue after this, really intimate House Denzel made the, most of that second chance building a, career that has brought him riches Fame, and critical Acclaim and so why would an, actor who makes millions for one movie, risk his reputation by taking a role, that pays Seventeen hundred dollars a, week what do you get out of it I mean, when when you go through this, performance eight times a week, it's like retooling the the lights come, up with the curtain goes up and it's an, actor's medium on stage and and you know, it's it's flying by the seat of your, pants you got to keep going it's live, things happen we're still going through, things things fall and lights don't work, you forget lines or whatever happens and, that's good that's good exercise cell, phones go off cell phones go off one of, these days I'm going to respond to it in, iambic pentameter answer at that, my Lord my Lord it is for you, Heavens I'd rather coin my heart this, production has traded ancient Rome's, togas and tunics for suits ties and, camouflage, it is set in Modern Times And is, intended to be evocative of power, struggles in cities like Washington or, Baghdad what makes the play Julius, Caesar relevant today, well again I mean it's it's what ifs we, do have, leaders in the world that think they're, Gods I mean and it's not just, governments it's corporations it's you, know unfortunately not a lot has changed, I think it's a part of the human, condition, are open two weeks ago to mixed reviews, but Denzel says reviews don't affect him, because he doesn't read them anyway the, show is nearly sold out for his, scheduled 112 performances that will run, until June performances that give him, something he doesn't get in Hollywood, how do you feel at the end, of a performance, I mean this is not an easy role thankful, you know I run off stage I wipe the, makeup off I say a quick prayer I hear, the people out there clap and you get a, sense saying oh is it two bows tonight, is it one is it three you know and uh, but a relief, you know, Joy, it it you don't get that in the movies, making movies you all the feelings I'm, getting night after night I mean people, are like man you got a hundred to go but, I'm like yeah I'm enjoying every one of, them,

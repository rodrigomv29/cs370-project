not since Watergate has an attorney, general been at the center of such a, firestorm Merrick Garland's justice, department is Prosecuting both former, president Trump and the son of President, Biden caught in the middle is this, 70-year-old former prosecutor and, well-respected judge with a long history, as a moderate we met Garland Friday in, Washington he told us that he devoted, his life to the rule of law because of, his family's struggle to escape the, Holocaust now he's responsible for, prosecutions that will shape the future, of the nation in a rare interview the, Attorney General told us that in the, Trump and Biden trials ahead his, prosecutors will pursue Justice without, fear and without, favor the story will continue in a, moment, we do not have one rule for republicans, and another rule for Democrats we don't, have one rule for foes and another for, friends we don't have one rule for the, powerful another for the powerless for, the rich or for the poor based on, ethnicity we have only one rule and that, one rule is that we follow the facts and, the law and we reach the decisions, required by the Constitution and we, protect civil liberties are you, essentially saying as attorney general, to the American people trust me well in, the end I I suppose it does in the end, come down to trust but it's not just me, it's Decades of the of the Norms of this, department that are part of the DNA of, the career prosecutors who are running, the investigation um and supervising the, investigations that you're talking about, former president Trump faces two Federal, trials one for allegedly hoarding, classified documents and covering it up, the other for allegedly conspiring to, see power after the 2020 election, attorney general Garland has said little, about this and we wanted to understand, why well I think the first thing to, understand is because these are pending, cases because there are two federal, indictments the long-standing rule in, the Justice Department is that we can't, comment about pending cases where does, that rule come from what's the point one, reason is to protect the privacy and, civil liberties of the person who's, under investigation it's to protect, Witnesses who also may or may not become, public later in an investigation and, then finally it's to protect the, investigation itself um investigations, proceed in many different directions, eventually coming to a fruition a, decision to charge or not charge about a, particular thing or not and if Witnesses, and potential subjects knew everything, that the investigators had previously, looked at and we about to look at it, could well change testimony it could, well make make Witnesses unavailable to, us and this is not peculiar to the Trump, investigations well this is a rule for, all investigations this is part of what, we call our Justice manual it's been, there for probably at least 30 years and, probably longer than that help us, understand the, timing these prosecutions of the former, president are happening during the, campaign you could make the argument, that it's the worst possible, time the justice department has general, practice IES about not making, significant overt steps or charging, within a month or so of an election we, are clearly outside that uh that time, frame uh in these cases um prosecutors, special counsel they follow the facts in, the law where they lead when they've, gotten the amount of evidence necessary, to make a charging decision and have, decided that a charge is warranted, that's when they bring their cases the, investig ation itself has determined the, timing yes exactly right your critics, say that it's time to ruin Mr Trump's, chances in the election well that's, absolutely not true justice department, prosecutors are nonpartisan they don't, allow partisan considerations to play, any role in their determinations the, prosecutor in the Trump cases is Jack, Smith he was named by Garland to be, special counsel that's a job under the, regulations of the justice department, designed to give Smith broad, independence from the department and, from the White House the most important, aspect of the regulations is that the, special councel is not subject to the, day-to-day supervision of anyone in the, Justice Department you are not in, communication with the president or any, member of his administration with regard, to the investigation of former president, Trump no I am not if President Biden, asked you you to take action with regard, to the Trump investigation what would, your reaction be I am sure that that, will not happen um but I would not uh do, anything um in that regard um and if, necessary I would resign but I there is, no sense that anything like that will, happen have you ever had to tell him, hands off these investigations Mr, President no because he has never tried, to put hands on these investigations, separately president President Biden, himself is the subject of a special, councel investigation into whether he, improperly held classified documents, after he was vice president his son, Hunter Biden is the target of a 4year, investigation into his business deals, and his taxes he's been indicted for, lying about drug abuse when he bought a, gun Republicans accus special counsel, David Weiss of slow walking the hunter, Biden investigation the allegation is Mr, attorney, general that what is described in some, quarters as the Biden justice, department is taking it easy on the, president's son well look um this, investigation began under David Weiss uh, David Weiss is a long-standing career, prosecutor and he was appointed by Mr, Trump as the United State's Attorney uh, for the District of Delaware I promised, at my nomination hearing that I would, continue him on in that position uh and, that I would not interfere with this, investigation you are not participating, in those decisions no Mr Weiss is making, those decisions the White House is not, attempting to influence those decisions, absolutely not and he said we won't have, to take his word for it under justice, department regulations a special counsel, must write a final report which I will, make public to the extent um permissible, under the law um that is required to, explain their prosecutive decisions, their decisions to prosecute or not, prosecute and their strategic decisions, along the way usually the special, councils have testified at the end of, their reports and I expect that that, will be the case here how's your, relationship with the president it must, be, Frosty I have a good working, relationship with the president good, perhaps but maybe not close the, president addressed the question in, August when he spotted Garland at a, White House Event attorney general, Garland haven't seen you in a long while, good to see you Secretary of homelet you, think I'm kidding I'm, not attorney general Garland leads, 115,000 employees prosecutors agents of, the FBI and other federal law, enforcement additional security is now, assigned to protect judges and, prosecutors after the Trump cases Drew, death threats political violence is, among Garland's gravest, concerns people can argue with each, other as much as they want and as, vociferously as they want but the one, thing they may not do is use violence, and threats of violence to alter the, outcome and an important aspect of this, is the American people themselves the, American people must protect each, other they must, ensure that they treat each, other with Civility and kindness listen, to opposing views argue as vifer usly as, they want but refrain from violence and, threats of violence that's the only way, this democracy Will Survive why do you, feel so strongly about, that well I feel it for a number of, reasons and number of things that I've, seen but for my own family who who uh, fled uh religious persecution in Europe, um and some members who did not, uh survive when they got to the United, States the United States, protect it guaranteed uh that they could, practice their religion they could vote, they could do all the things they, thought a democracy would provide um, that's the difference between this, country and many other countries and, it's my responsibility it's the Justice, Department's responsibility to ensure, that that difference continues that we, protect each, other two of your ancestors were, murdered in the, Holocaust yes is that why you devoted, yourself to the, law yes uh that's I would say that's why, I devoted myself to the rule of law uh, to Public Service uh to try and to, ensure that the rule of law um um, governs this country and continues to, govern this country Merrick Garland has, spent a life in the law m e r r i c k g, a r l a n d he's the associate Deputy, attorney general at Justice he oversaw, the Oklahoma City bombing case at Act of, political terrorism later after nearly, two decades as a federal appeals court, judge he was nominated to the US Supreme, Court by President Obama but Republicans, stalled the nomination for 10 months, until Donald Trump was sworn in, president-elect Biden picked Garland for, Attorney, General on the same day the capital was, attacked that became one of the largest, investigations in the Department's, history we've U arrested and brought, charges against more than 1,00 uh people, um there are uh more to come um the, videos that uh every single person uh, happen to have on their phones uh that, security cameras had that bystanders had, that the media had at the time uh, disclosed faces some of which we have, not yet been able to connect uh to, people you're looking for new suspects, new defendants still yeah there it's not, that they're new suspects but there they, are people that we haven't found yet why, do these prosecutions mean so much to, you because this is a fundamental aspect, of our democracy if we can't ensure that, this kind of behavior doesn't recur it, will occur the prosecutions we bring are, deterrence against that from happening, Garland knows he will be vilified no, matter how the Trump and Biden cases are, decided his job he told us was to take, the arrows for the Department he has, learned to embrace the pain that comes, with the job the youngest right now is, Riot Mitchell Forever 8 months old and, we saw that at DEA headquarters where he, was surrounded by those lost to the, opioid epidemic is the attorney general, and their grieving families meeting them, he told us reminds him of why he fights, and whom he is fighting for thank you, for being here and listening to us I, represent the American people um I don't, represent the president I represent the, American people and likewise I am not, congress's prosecutor I work for the, American, people and if democracy is an emotional, subject for Merrick Garland maybe it's, because he has witnessed how suddenly it, can be threatened in Oklahoma City and, Washington, DC when the history of this, extraordinary time is written what is, the best that Merrick Garland can hope, for look I think it's the best any, public servant can hope for that we've, done our best that we pass on a justice, department that uh continues to pursue, the rule of law and protect it uh and, it's it's the same thing that every, generation has to Hope um that we can, pass our democracy on in working order, um to the next uh generation that picks, up the torch and is responsible when, we're finished uh to continue that, job,

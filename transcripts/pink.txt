2023 has been a year of soldout Stadium, concerts but only one of the women, breaking attendance records has built a, global brand singing upside down, highflying stunts are only part of her, appeal Alicia Moore is known as much for, her party anthems as her Powerhouse, voice and if the name is unfamiliar it's, because she's best known by her one-word, professional identity pink pink famously, has no filter and fans who have followed, her 25y year career have come to expect, her to share every detail of her, sometimes troubled, story the story will continue in a, moment do I have this right you're, willing to talk about anything any, question is fine there's no offense, taken yeah it's all I'm I'm open to all, of it a lot of people in your world, thrive on protecting privacy, you're an open book why I guess I look, at it in a very specific way if I'm a, mystery to you how can I expect you to, connect with me and if I'm a person, that's desperate for connection then why, would mystery be interesting to me I, want to know you I want you to know me, all right you guys want to start with, start by coming to one of her concerts, we were there for her homecoming shows, in Philadelphia last month One Stop on a, year and a half long tour hello, beautiful people, she's already set attendance records in, stadiums around the, world and sold more than $350 million in, tickets a pink concert is part Rock, rager Park Broadway spectacle never, going, to again never going, to, again with some Tinker Bells sprinkled, in she belts out her hits while flipping, and flying 100 fet in the air and she, does it without lip, syncing when she says she actually sings, better upside down, believer, Now 44 when she looks out into the crowd, she sees a lot more moms and dads she, calls herself and her fans the uncool, kids and takes great pleasure in taking, on their haters whether in her shows or, on social media her message is don't, mess with them or, me this image that you've created you've, got this famous, snarl yeah right I wonder if when that, started the message was this is a woman, that you don't want to mess with well, this is a woman you don't want to mess, with is a true statement I know what, certain people think of when they look, at me down to the fact that I'm muscular, I'm outspoken and I have short hair I'm, possibly a dude definitely a lesbian, people sort of put you in a box no, matter what you look like and my box, happens to be if if you're outspoken and, you don't sort of Bend to societal Norms, then you're scary and dangerous and the, reality is the reality is I am the, goofiest most fun loving person that, will possibly kick your ass if I have, to come on children these days life is, less get the party started and more get, these kids to bed her six-year-old son, Jameson push and 12-year-old daughter, Willow are often on tour with her riding, their scooters on stage during sound, checks for the hometown show in

needs to return we have a, little sheet you actually have a sign, wish I had the thing but we don't have, that so I've been backstage for other, artists and some of the things I've seen, are lot of booze lot of party cool my, dressing room used to be like whiskey, and cigarettes then it was ball pits and, stuffed, animals when she's not on the road she's, home in Southern, California this is where she's Alicia, Moore a mohawk wearing mom who bakes, sourdough and is part of the, PTA she's either driving for school drop, off or or driving a forklift on her 25, acre Vineyard she says she schooled, herself on the science of wine making by, studying lat to the night after her, shows so do I have this correct you, don't make pink Rosé I do not make pink, Rosé my ganache is it looks like a white, wine occasionally it's a bit Peach but, you drink it I drink a lot well Biggie, Smalls once said never get high on your, own Supply but he sure did I do make a, lot of wine home is also where she makes, music this is my music room it's really, great yeah she's a writer on most of her, songs and says no topic is off limits, not even the ups and downs in her, marriage and you taught yourself to play, on this sort of kind of I mean I can, play halves of songs one of my favorite, songs is Make You Feel My Love and I, played this every day during, Co this is a bob Dylan song made most, recently Famous by Adele it's one of my, favorite, songs when the rain is blowing in your, face and the whole world is on your, c i could offer you a warm, embrace To Make You Feel My, Love so I played that every day wow, until I was good enough to go on stage, and play an instrument she grew up, singing opera and gospel in Doylestown, Pennsylvania but she says tension at, home made her desperate to leave she, calls her relationship with her father, Jim Moore complicated he served in, Vietnam and passed away two years ago as, a teen arguments with her mother were so, bad pink says one fight got physical and, her mom fell down stairs she now calls, that her one regret in life you said you, were the kid that other moms didn't want, their kids to play with why I was a punk, I had a mouth I was I had a chip on my, shoulder basically I grew up in a house, where every day my parents were, screaming at each other throwing things, hated each other and then I got into, drugs I was selling drugs and then I was, kicked out of the house I dropped out of, high school I was off the rails what, happened on Thanksgiving in, 1995 Thanksgiving of 1995 I was at a, rave, and I, overdosed I was, on oh boy, ecstasy angel dust Crystal all kinds of, things and then I was out done too much, you almost died yeah remember she says, that was the end of hard drugs for her, and weeks later got her first record, deal as the lead singer in an R&B girl, group but they didn't last long so when, you're starting out the industry sort of, seems like they've got you going down a, path they paint you with an R&B brush, yes I signed to laf face records we were, the token white girls on a black label I, was told to take etiquette classes very, early on uh they wanted me to learn how, to wear dresses and use the Right Fork, how'd that work out I went once but it, didn't work what did they not like I, think they were trying to turn me into, something that I didn't want to be image, is everything in this business using her, teenage nickname pink she went solo and, her first album was an R&B double, Platinum, success she then broadened her sound to, include Rock and, pop and not so subtly named her next, album, misunderstood it was a career defining, hit selling 15 million cop cies around, the, world you'd said in the past it felt, like you were never winning the, popularity contest among your peers what, do you mean by that we sold 3 million, tickets in the last 6 months but you, don't really hear about it unless you, went so at the end of the day do I give, a who talks about me as long as the mom, and the daughter or the dad who's in the, pink T-shirt as well as his daughter and, her three friends had a fantastic time, or the gay couple that came together and, felt super safe at my show because no, one heckled, them that's what really, matters and then there's, this, we wanted to know how she does it, singing upside down as an asmatic no, less well it took a lot of childhood, gymnastics classes and tortured training, sessions with her aerialist coach Drea, Weber okay tighten up your stomach ready, be nice now sing where there is there is, beame come on there is a flame someone B, to get burned just because it burns, doesn't mean you're going to die you got, to, get I'm not just a singer I'm a gymnast, I can do all kinds of things I'm, physical this body like this the muscles, that that scare people are it's my power, right it's like I don't eat well to look, good I eat well to go far fast and, hard at 53 she is all muscle and make no, mistake as tough as she looks, I realized that the machete that I've, always carried this metaphorical machete, that I've always carried that made me a, really difficult kid is what makes me, really good at what I did today and it, makes me a Survivor do you feel like you, needed that hard Edge that machete to, climb as far as you've climbed in this, business absolutely I never got a record, deal because I was cute I got a record, deal cuz I was fiery I had a lot to say, and I had a voice so I'm relieved I, don't have to fall back on sort of, conventional Beauty and and that doesn't, have to be my thing and I don't have to, keep that up either as I age I don't, have to be that I can be all of this she, won't need a plan B anytime soon but as, she told us at midnight over a glass of, wine in her dressing room in, Philadelphia she is planning the next, chapter it's what any self-respecting, acrobatic sequin loving Entertainer, would do a Las Vegas, residency I would like to have the best, show that Vegas has ever seen and I, think that I can for a performer like me, to have a stage that doesn't have to, travel oh my God you can do so much so, all these years in what's the hardest, part about your job now I guess that I, keep demanding more and more and more, and more from myself physically, emotionally, spiritually vocally I want to raise the, bar all the time and I'm sort of going, against time right how do you keep out, doing that I like going against societal, Norms when they say a woman has to slow, down become smaller take up less space, calm down no absolutely not why who says, why can't we ride till the wheels fall, off that's what I plan on, doing go backstage with pink after a, concert come on get in at 60 minutes, overtime.com,

you'd expect a 600-year old sport to, have played through its identity crisis, not the case for pool the Sport's very, name comes from pooling money to, determine odds and wagering lens pool, Mystique hustling and pool go together, like atick and chalk but that's as much, a curse as a blessing how can a sport, Thrive at the highest level when so much, of it exists in the shadows well here, comes van boning from Rapid City as we, first told you in December at age 39, with no interest in gambling van boning, is arguably the best American player, ever to break a rack and was ranked, number one in the world for 2022 he also, happens to be deaf can the South Dakota, kid help turn pool popular in bars and, basement but not on TV into a proper Pro, Sport we hit the circuit with him to, find, out the story we'll continue in a, moment another day another casino hotel, Shane Van boning spends 300 days a year, on the road playing professional pool, today he's clocking in early at the, Jamboree of American pool tournaments, the Derby City, Classic held every January outside, Louisville Derby City is a colorful, expression of pool's split personality, downstairs a felt ocean drawing dozens, of the world's best practitioners they, compete 12 hours a day for 9 days in, multiple, events this winner is smiling ear to ear, and his check tops out at, $166,000 but upstairs it's a different, economy behold pool's zestier side popup, action rooms standing room only where, Pros amateurs and wannabes alike come to, the table for unofficial competition the, signs say no smoking and no gambling and, we sure didn't see any smoking tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of, dollars Big Timber they call it change, hands until the sun comes up one player, we didn't see gambling upstairs Shane, Van bony a generational Talent known for, his killer, break van boning has won the US Open, five times and been named player of the, decade deaf since birth he wears hearing, aids and shuts down any question this, makes it harder for him to play, pool it's actually a big Advantage for, me how's that you know when I play po, tournament I can just shut it off do you, shut your hearing aids off when you play, when I want my first Uso and I had, everything off I was focused total, silence yes I'm totally like 100% zon in, never more zoned in than in 2018 when he, led the United States to victory over, Europe at the muscone cup P's answer to, golf's Rider cup and he is going for it, he closed it out with an off angle long, distance 1 n combo this highrisk High, reward pressure packed shot what a shot, Shane Van boning and Team, USA unbelievable finish think you could, have made that, shot we went to Rapid City South Dakota, a side pocket of America to Van Bon's, pool hall where he explained that making, balls disappear into pockets is only, half of pool Excellence it's also about, setting up your neck shot, Q ball control they call it and I'm, going to make the Q ball stop right here, so I can shoot the two in the, side then I'm, going you did that how how did you do, that just hit it right below Center so, now it lines up that next ball perfectly, yeah I'm so struck by the geometry of, all this yeah I love geometry it's all, about the angles van boning says he can, see every angle on the table a six sense, that comes from practicing as much as 10, hours a day shooting half a million, balls a year I want to make the shot, perfect the only way to hit it perfect, you got to do it over and over and over, can you be perfect in this, sport, no I tried so hard so all these years, van boning comes by it honestly his, grandfather Gary Bloomberg a known, trickshot artist opened pool halls off, I90 easy access for Hustlers passing, across the Great Plains but these rooms, were familyfriendly places so much so, Shane got his first pool queue when he, was two and went to the pool room every, day after school not just to play but to, escape kids who picked on him for being, deaf how bad did it get the kid would, start throwing Ros at me they would put, gum in my hair and then I would go home, to my mom I'd be going home crying you, know and then she made me feel feel, better by asking me you want to go to, the pool room why did coming to the pool, room make you feel better you know when, you walk in the pool room what do you, see you know you see people having a, good time but it was more than that he, had prodigious ability for thinking, multiple Strokes ahead when van boning, was 18 he hit the road he and his uncle, loaded into an RV looking for money, games came to play pool fats of course, they did the Hustler that stealth, roadman armed only with a wooden stick, in confidence divorcing the locals from, their cash has been romanticized for, decades not least by Paul Newman this, reporter was so taken by po hustling he, once wrote a book about it for Van, boning the romance hit the Rocks, abruptly yeah I actually was playing the, pool in Tennessee and I was playing this, guy for money and we were playing for a, whole lot and he was, losing and he picked up the key ball and, threw it at me where'd he hit you he hit, me right on the chest it's the kind of, thing you do to start a fight yeah how'd, you react I told my Uncle I said I don't, want to do this anymore I don't want to, live on the road anymore it's just too, dangerous here we go for the title he, chose to go legit and began playing and, winning proper tournaments though less, lucrative than the rambling gambling, life van boning enjoyed being a, professional did you worry that coming, in off the road was going to impact your, your finances, I know some of the pool players like the, top pool players were making money so if, they can do it I can do it but pool is a, deceptively tricky sport next up two, superpowers Collide just ask Shane's, Scottish counterpart Jason Shaw another, top player earlier this year Shaw holed, up in a Virginia pool room for 5 days, and broke the straight pool record, making 74 shots in a row the stuff that, happens in pool will completely screw, your brain up what do you mean you'll, see shots that and you'll be like how, did that happen you'll you'll hear that, all day how did that land over there did, you see that how that went in in pool, you see at every game something weird, will happen does that make it more, exhilarating or more frustrating both, mentally you want to like flip the table, at some point you ever flipped a table, no I've thought about it a few times, people come in how hard could it be it's, just a rectangle with six and then 20, minutes later there's still 15 balls on, the table they've not poted a ball and, the guy's like scratching his head like, thought this was easy it's, not we watched you at Derby City play, Jason Shaw Jason who yeah is he rival, yeah it's been going on for several, years now he's a great player and um, we're always going to have a battle you, okay with that yeah you have to accept, losing if you don't accept losing you're, just you're going to go crazy I'll stick, is the ice right here if having a rival, is Central to being being an elite, athlete so is this leaving time to clear, your head so it was we found ourselves, following Shane Van boning out on to, Paola Lake in the Black, Hills van boning goes fishing season be, damned every morning when he's back home, we didn't catch any fish we did catch, van bony's drift though his take on the, virtues of complete, silence vanity plate notwithstanding few, extravagances come with being number one, in pool the ragtag pro tour barely, televised in the US struggles to draw, much interest or investment outside of, pool die hards how many sponsors do you, have I have six sponsors cues and tables, and Pool Products yes and any sponsors, outside of pool no what can a top player, make top and pool can make only six, figures half expenses maybe five figures, no one's making a million bucks as a, pool player it never, happened van boning says cleaning up the, sport doing away with back room money, games would lure big corporate sponsors, big media deals and grow professional, pool we saw firsthand his discomfort, with gambling and all that comes with it, when we interviewed you in in dery city, I don't if you remember the the, interview was interrupted you you recall, what, happened oh the, gambling was that what happened yeah, it was morning at Derby City and the, action upstairs from the night before, was still, simmering they, arguing over the course of a few minutes, two players who' bet on a game nearly, came to blows you cannot gamble you know, van boning could only shake his head it, got to be a clean sport Ender prop, pool's unlikely new Guardian Emily, Fraser of the British sports promoter, matchroom the company recently revamp, Pro darts and snooker in the UK, streamlining their circuits and turning, top players into celebrities who make, millions oh that's where the tra sits, Fraser is tasked with doing the same for, pool and she says gambling is the least, of her worries what's the state of, professional pool today ah an absolute, mess why' you say that the first ever US, Open that I did in, 2019 oh my gosh the players turned up, they were in jeans when I'm going hang, on a second like what's happening here, why is this guy turning up in jeans, Fraser has asked Pro players to dress, the part but she won't ask them to give, up their side hustles now all of the, basement tables and the money matches I, think that's brilliant and that can, still yeah I think that it's fantastic, because it's got the history behind it, you're okay if people are still they're, gambling and playing money games as far, as I'm concerned in a couple years time, they won't need to have any money it'll, be obsolete the market will do its thing, exactly but right now now it's not, viewed as this professional sport and it, has all the ingredients to be one she, standardize the format this is, commercialized sponsor friendly nineball, not the solids and Stripes eight ball, you've likely played in October at the, US Open held in Atlantic City Fraser, brought in bigger live audiences and, ramped up TV production she's kept one, pool Hallmark the Smoke Filled Room, close but no cigar there's a machine, puffing away in the corner When the, Smoke cleared there was Shane Van, boning he was fresh off winning his, first world championship sealing his, status at top the sport he confided to, us that he'd slept with the trophy for a, month van boning is mobbed at pool, tournaments but can still walk through, an airport unbothered well he's no, LeBron James and I totally understand, that and I recognize that um it's our, job to turn that around it is our, responsibility to turn that world number, one prize money from, $80,000 to a million so it's prize money, it's more events and let's get these, players known you've got to fall in love, with them are they lovable yes some of, them the health of the sport also, depends on minting a new generation of, elite players so this tournament had a, junior division held alongside the pros, and named what else the Shane Van boning, Jr open these are future Pros oh yeah, definitely definitely they have so much, passion for the game and then I'm going, to shoot the Shish back at the pool hall, in Rapid City we experience pool's highs, and lows in the same, hour didn't even let me hit a ball ever, the sports gentleman Shane Van boning, wouldn't let us leave without setting us, up to s a trick shot pool may or may not, clean up its act but any sport that can, provide this kind of pure simple thrill, just go right down the middle yep right, down the middle you reckon it'll survive, just, fine you got, that,

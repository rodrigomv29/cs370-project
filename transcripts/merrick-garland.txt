conventionally 60 Minutes doesn't, profile the same subject twice in two, seasons but convention doesn't intersect, with Pro Football Hall of Famer Dion, Sanders last fall we met Sanders in, Mississippi where he was coaching, Jackson State to prominence in a, conference of historically black, colleges and universities then the man, who calls himself coach prime high, stepped it to Boulder to the University, of Colorado taking his blazingly, singular Style with him there he hasn't, just awoken a dormant program but has, transformed it into the talk of college, football if not American Sports Sanders, is revered he is reviled but a Sudden, Impact is indisputable for the second, time in two radically different, environments Unapologetic as ever he's, shaken the sport like a snow globe, the story will continue in a moment, are you the change agent are you the, ultimate change agent I make a, difference I truly make a difference I, make folks nervous man I give folks, moving in their seat I get folks, twirling their thumbs I get them, thinking and second guessing they said, you know have you ever been so clean, that you walked in and somebody looked, down at you then they looked at, themselves they had to check themselves, because you were so clean I have that, effect that's the vibe you're getting I, have that effect, that was some good game right there but, God that was good we ain't got next, we got now, this was the scene in the locker room, two weekends ago, before the Colorado Buffaloes and their, new coach Dion Sanders opened the season, to 21 Point Underdog at PCU good job, Colorado was fresh off a 1 in 11 season, TCU was fresh from playing in last, season's national championship game, with skill and will the Buffaloes won, 45-42 behind their Star Quarterback, shudor Sanders but the real Focus as, ever was on shidur's 56 year old father, it was his first win as coach of a power, five School the highest level of college, football do you feel like you were, underestimated if you come here and it's, I don't know if coach Prime can win you, must have heard what some of these other, coaches were saying both secretly, fear yeah that's fear that's like hey, man, shoot we don't want to let that Engine, That Could get going because if that, Engine That Could get going he gonna, start saying I think I can I think I can, the sooner the lady he gonna start, saying I know I can I know I can't then, soon the lady going to start saying I, did that, his Colorado debut Drew national, attention and monster TV ratings, interest compounded last weekend when, the Buffaloes played before the biggest, home crowd in 15 years in beat rival, Nebraska, this weekend both Fox and ESPN, dispatched their pregame shows the rock, included to Boulder then the Buffaloes, rallied late to beat Colorado State in a, double overtime Thriller, three games into the season the, foothills of the Rockies marked the, unlikely epicenter of an entire sport, what's this been like for you, um it's it's been a lot of fun, Rick George who hired coach Prime has, been Colorado's athletic director for a, decade it's great for us to be able to, bring this program back to relevancy and, we had failed in my previous nine years, 10 years fair to call this bit of a Hail, Mary it wasn't a Hail Mary but it was a, moment in time for our University and, our athletic department that we were, either going to be relevant or we were, going to be irrelevant, it's too early to quantify the full, Prime effect but merchandise sales up, 819 from last season Instagram followers, up more than tenfold season tickets sold, out, Sanders might be the ideal coach for, these shifting times in college football, another son Dion JR is part of the army, of videographers filming the team, non-stop for YouTube and an upcoming, docu-series, steam won one game last season is that, in a way a point of appeal God wouldn't, relocate me to something that was, successful that don't make sense to it, he had to find the most, disappointing in the most uh difficult, task, in this, is what it was and this is what it is, and I love that, this wasn't dissimilar to what he told, us last year that God had called him, collect to come to Jackson State, University and Elevate yes the football, program but also all hbcus, he stayed three seasons but the same, night last December that JSU won the, conference Championship Sanders, announced he was off to Colorado to, climb Another Mountain you left Jackson, State and you left quickness, leave quick I left what I was supposed, to leave, to leave most coaches get a new job and, they leave expeditiously I finished the, task you say finish the task was there, was there more work you could have done, in Jackson or I think we did a, tremendous job in Jackson I think we, laid down the tremendous blueprint, we tried to press Sanders on the, circumstances surrounding his abandoning, the mission at Jackson State he's hinted, the school's lack of Forward Thinking, may have factored in his decision but on, this topic he was about as elusive as he, was returning punts for touchdowns in, the NFL what'd you tell his kids when, you left, um opportunity, called sooner and later in life there, will be opportunity that knocks at your, door and at this juncture in my life I, felt like the opportunity for not only, me but for my kids as well was, tremendous not only did we take several, kids from that team, three trainers, maybe 12 to 14 staffers so we afforded, to give people a tremendous opportunity, here, the distance between Jackson and Boulder, is a thousand miles and immeasurably, further culturally Sanders went from a, city that is 83 percent black to one, that is one percent black from a place, with a Water Crisis to the kind of, hipster college town where there's a, shop devoted to kites what are your, first impressions uh beautiful, unbelievable just the whole peace and, serenity of it all I never fathom coming, here I ain't never even vacation here, man I ain't never been skiing or, whatever you call it snowboarding or, whatever all the stuff you know ain't, never done none of that you don't even, fly fish no I don't I fish, I'm fly why I fish but I don't fly fish, still he wasted no time ingratiating, himself in the community including a, visit to Peggy coppam a 98 year old, Buffalo Super Fan, how about good looking this, he was less embracing of the incumbent, Colorado players at the first team, meeting in December Sanders encouraged, players to enter the transfer portal an, open market for athletes to find new, schools I promise you it's my job to get, rid of them and make room for Superior, Talent he planned to bring in more than, 50 players eventually transferred out, you got here and you didn't pull punches, you told some of these guys have I ever, you take a team that's won one game and, you fired a whole coaching staff so who, did the coaching staff recruit, the kids, so the kids are just, as much to blame as the coaching staff, and I came to the conclusion that a, multitude of them can help us get to, where we wanted to go you told most of, these guys the more you jump in the more, room you're going to make those of you, we don't run off we're going to try to, make you quit yeah you made it very, clear yeah now if you went for that if, you were able to let words run you off, you ain't for us because we're old, school staff we coach hard we coach tuck, we're disciplined narrants so if you're, allowing verbiage to run you off because, you don't feel secure with your ability, you ain't for us, if some kid said you know what no I'm, staying you're not going to run me off, with your words right stay so prove it, I'm sure that your straight talk was, appreciated by some but is this scorched, Earth policy good for for college, football or for the kids I think truth, is good for kids we're so busy lying we, don't even recognize the truth no more, in society we want everybody to feel, good that's not that's not the way life, is now it is my job to make sure I have, what we need to win, that makes a lot of people feel good, winning does I got to push back on this, you're a father of college athletes yes, if they called you and say hey we got a, new coach and they're telling me to get, in the transfer portal I say son you, must be you must not be doing well, that's what you said you must not be, doing well because you should be an, asset and not a liability I'm honest, with my kids his kids include shador the, star quarterback in Shiloh of starting, safety if you guys have any idea that, you are going to be this good and, capture the country the way you have, yeah you did yeah we both didn't come, here, have our dad closing just to lose, a year ago to the day we watched the, door fleeing and Zing touchdown passes, at Jackson State, but there were questions about whether, he could do the same against stiffer, competition well in his first two games, at Colorado he threw for nearly 1 000, yards without an interception, you were putting up big numbers at, Jackson State you're doing it here, against teams and the Big Ten yeah the, big 12. must be gratifying yeah now, these two games was the most yards I, passed for in my career, so it's just it's just exciting knowing, that you know to translate and like on a, bigger stage I just feel better he's, also and again welcome to today's, college sports translated his success, into riches thanks to nil name image, likeness income so much so he drives a, one hundred and ninety thousand dollar, Mercedes Maybach and chidur might not, even be the team's best player Travis, Hunter also followed coach Prime from, Jackson to Colorado his coach lets him, play offense and defense virtually, unheard of in the modern college game, you've got two really good Heisman, quality players on this team yes your, son and Travis Hunter yes sir first half, of the first game of the season you're, already publicly talking about Travis, Hunter's Heisman chances who does that a, a coach that loves his kids the coach, that understands that's what those kids, desire and I supposed to do that that's, what we told them when they were coming, and choosing to play for us my kids that, play for me they didn't choose a, university, they chose me that's the difference, coaches have chosen to join Sanders as, well the staff he overhauled and, upgraded includes former head coaches, and former coordinators from schools, like Alabama now that you're a power, Five Guy mm-hmm who's the best coach in, college football today, let me see let me see a mirror so I can, look at it, you feel that, you think I'm gonna sit up here and tell, you somebody else, you think you think that's the way I, operate that somebody else got that on, me but I tell you this, I love and I adore and I respect and, every time I do a commercial with Coach, Saban it's a gift just sitting in his, presence and hearing him and and, throwing something else out there so I, could hear his viewpoint on it because, he's forgotten more things than I may, ever accomplish so I'm a student looking, up to this wonderful teacher saying, just just throw me a crumb of what you, know, for all the bling and Bluster there is, some humility and the current Mania may, die down a bit as Colorado faces a, Welter of tougher opponents the rest of, the season, but Dion Sanders has invigorated the, campus a program an entire sport game, ball Peggy, and damn if, fun give me my theme music,

Israel has begun what prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu calls the second, stage of the war by expanding its, military ground operations in Gaza we, spoke with vice president kamla Harris, this past week as the Biden, Administration was trying to balance, Israel's need to retaliate against Hamas, with the urgent need to get relief to, the Palestinian people vice president, Harris told us she is also involved in, the administration's efforts on the war, in Ukraine as well as countless, intractable problems including gun, violence at home but with the Middle, East on a Razor's Edge we started our, conversation, there the story will continue in a, moment how close is this to becoming a, regional conflict that could draw in US, troops we have absolutely no intention, nor do we have any plans to send, combat troops into Israel or Gaza period, vice president Harris told us the US is, not telling Israel what to do but is, providing advice equipment and, diplomatic support a terrorist, organization Hamas, slaughtered hundreds of young people at, a concert by most estimates at least,, 1400 Israelis are dead Israel without, any question has a right to defend, itself that being said it is very, important that there be no conflation, between Hamas and the Palestinians the, Palestinians, deserve equal measures of Safety and, Security self-determination and dignity, and we have been very clear that the, rules of war must be adhered to and that, there be human humanitarian Aid that, flows she told told us the US wants to, keep the conflict from escalating but, that's proving difficult in the last two, weeks Hezbollah in lebanan and the, houthis in Yemen both proxies of Iran, have launched missiles rockets and, drones against Israel and Iranian backed, militias have fired on US troops, stationed in Iraq and Syria in response, the US launched air strikes against, Iranian weapons facilities in Syria if, that weren't enough of a signal to Iran, and other adversaries the Pentagon has, also deployed two imposing aircraft, carrier strike groups to the region and, what's the message to Iran, don't as President Biden said just don't, exactly one word pretty, straightforward since the Hamas attack, on Israel the Vice President says she, has spoken with President Isaac Herzog, of Israel and joined President Biden on, calls with prime minister Benjamin, Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority, president Mahmud abas President Joe, Biden told us in a statement this is as, high stakes and complex a situation as, it gets and kamla is my partner in all, of it he told us Harris's advice and, counsel are, invaluable when he was vice president Mr, Biden famously said that he wanted to be, the last person in the room with, President Obama do you have that, relationship with President Biden I do, you do I do and um and I take that, responsibility quite seriously how often, do you meet with him multiple times a, day quite often unless he or I are, traveling they're in total agreement the, US must stand with Israel and Ukraine, two democracies under attack we, are as, committed to Ukraine as we've always, been to, authorize additional Aid to defend, itself against Russia's unprovoked, aggression that is not going to waver, does this war in the Middle East put, Ukraine on a back burner not for us no, it does not put us put them on a back, burner at, all vice president Harris has visited 19, countries and met with more than 100, world, leaders but lately she has been the, administration's Point person on, domestic priorities traveling the, country talking up the Democrats key, issues before the 2024 election issues, she hopes will fire up the base but are, bound to inflame the, GOP she went to North Carolina to Mark, the anniversary of the Supreme Court, overturning Ro v Wade how dare they, attack our fundamental, rights how dare they attack our freedom, in Virginia it was Guns our nation is, being torn apart by gun, violence we joined the vice president, and second gentleman Doug mhof on Air, Force 2 for a trip to Las Vegas it was 5, days after the terror attack on Israel, welcome on Bo thank, you while in the air the vice president, joined a secure video call with the, president and their national security, teams to discuss measures to keep the, Homeland safe, once on the ground in Las, Vegas vice president Harris went to the, College of Southern Nevada the eighth, stop on her fight for our freedoms, College Tour because you voted Joe Biden, is president of the United States and I, am Vice President of the United States, because you voted but nationally the, Biden Harris Administration is not, generating the kind of enthusiasm she's, seeing on her tour a recent CBS poll, found that at the beginning of President, Biden's term 70% of young people people, under 30 said he was doing a good job, now it's less than, 50% why is that what's going on if you, pull how young people feel about the, climate and the warming of our planet it, pulls as one of their top concerns when, we talk about what we are doing with, student loan debt polls very high the, challenge that we have as an, Administration is we got to let people, know who BR it to them that's our, challenge but it is not that the work we, are doing is not very very popular with, a lot of people she blames the, disconnect in part on lack of media, coverage still the vice president, herself is not very popular now just 41%, of adults told CBS news they approve of, the job she's doing about the same for, President Biden we talked to her the day, before the Carnage in Maine but she had, told us issues like mass shootings are, more important than poll numbers you, have a portfolio that includes gun, violence the root cause of migration, these are some of the most intractable, issues facing the country we've done, some of the most significant gun safety, laws in 30 years but we still need an, assault weapons ban it doesn't have to, be this way there was an assault weapons, ban at one time it expired let's renew, it most Americans say that they don't, think you're doing a good job on the, border you and the administration the, number of people trying to cross the US, Southern border is at an all-time high, it's no secret that we have a broken, immigration system shortterm we need a, safe orderly and Humane border policy, and long-term we need to invest in the, root causes of migration but the bottom, line Congress needs to act come on, participate in the solution instead of, political gamesmanship if politics is a, game kamla Harris has proven herself to, be a Savvy player forging a career that, has gone from one first to another the, child of an Indian mother and a Jamaican, father she was the first woman district, attorney for San Francisco the first, woman to serve as California attorney, general the first woman of color elected, senator from California so help me God, and the first woman and woman of color, to be elected vice president of the, United States being in that unique, position being that first yeah does that, bring added pressure no doubt no doubt, you know my mother she would say KLA you, may be the first to do many things make, sure you're not the, last and among the, responsibilities that I carry and maybe, impose on myself that is one of them so, this was she showed us around the vice, president's ceremonial office I brought, in this bust of th Good Marshall uh and, I always have him over my right shoulder, in the drawer here the desk where, previous vice presidents left their, signatures alore Quail Cheney Harry, Truman some of these men went on to, become president but kamla Harris told, us she is focused on getting the Biden, Harris ticket reelected next year the, GOP is using her low poll numbers and, President Biden's age as a battering ram, and some Democrats are growing worried, we were talking to some democratic, donors and they have told us that should, something befall President Biden and he, is not able to run that there would be a, freefor all for who would run as, president you are in the spot that that, would be a natural for you to step up, but we're hearing from donors that they, would not naturally fall into line why, is that well first of all I'm not going, to engage in that hypothetical because, Joe Biden is very much alive and running, for re-election so you do know I mean, that is a concern and and a legitimate, concern I would say I hear from a lot of, different people a lot of different, things but let me just tell you I'm, focused on the job I truly am our, democracy is on the line bill and I, frankly in my head do not have time for, parlor games when we have a president, who is running for, reelection that's it Joe Biden, conventional wisdom is that most, presidential elections are won or lost, on the economy and while inflation has, been coming down prices for Basics like, food and shelter remain staggeringly, high we came into office during the, height of a pandemic record, unemployment and because of our economic, policies we now are reducing inflation, we have created over 14 million new jobs, we've created over 800,000 new, manufacturing jobs wages are up and so, we've seen great progress considering, what you are laying out as your, achievements you have the current front, runner for the GOP Donald Trump facing, what 91 criminal charges I've lost count, yet the Biden Harris ticket is running, neck and neck with Donald Trump why are, you not 30 points ahead well I'm not I'm, not a political pundit so I I I'm not, going to speak to that but what I will, say is this when the American people are, able to take a close look at election, time on their options I think the choice, is going to be clear Bill we're going to, win let me just tell you that we're, going to, win and I'm not saying it's going to be, easy but we will win you say that with, such conviction I have no doubt but I, also have no doubt it's going to be a, lot of work and everyone's going to have, to participate this is a, democracy democracy she said that word, often during our interview despite the, criticism and low poll numbers former, prosecutor kamla Harris told us she's, prepared to trust the verdict of the, American people do you have to ask, yourself why are people seeming not to, hear our message I look at it more as, let's keep getting out there and as with, any election we got to make our case to, the American people that's part of our, responsibility and that's this process, and that's what it is and that's a fair, process,
